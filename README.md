# Mean-Teacher-Model-DA
The Mean Teacher Model is a popular approach for semi-supervised learning, where a student model learns from a more stable teacher model that updates through Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It helps improve consistency between predictions and provides a smoother training signal.

Key Components of the Mean Teacher Model

Student Model: Learns from labeled and unlabeled data.

Teacher Model: A copy of the student that updates with EMA.

Consistency Loss: Encourages the student model to match the teacherâ€™s predictions for unlabeled data.

Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Update: Each parameter in the teacher model is updated using a weighted average of its previous values and the corresponding parameters in the student model:


The PACS dataset is widely used for domain generalization in computer vision. It consists of four domains

Each domain contains seven categories: Dog, Elephant, Giraffe, Guitar, Horse, and Person2. The dataset is designed to test how well models generalize across different visual styles.

### Observations
- **Supervised Loss:** Remains stable across epochs, suggesting effective labeled learning.
- **Unsupervised Loss:** Very low, indicating the student model aligns well with the teacher.
- **Domain Loss:** Fluctuates slightly but stays within a consistent range, reinforcing domain adaptation.

Consider tweaking hyperparameters like `lambda_dann` or `alpha` if further refinements are needed. ðŸš€
